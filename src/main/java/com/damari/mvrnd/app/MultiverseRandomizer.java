 * TP = S * e^r
 * S = Today's Stock Price
 * e = Tomorrow's Stock Price
 * r = drift
 *   r (v1 none) = 0
 *   r (v2 stdev) = u - Ïƒ2/2
 *   r (v3 rf int & volat) = Risk Free Rate - (Variance / 2)
 * u = Average of the Historical Periodic Return (eg daily, hourly, tick etc)

 *   "It seems that stocks do approximately follow a random walk, but there are other factors, such as those discussed
 *    by Fama and French (1995), which appear to affect stock prices as well."
